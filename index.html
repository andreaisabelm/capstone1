    <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p>A learner at heart, I have taken a new interest in the world of technology. I studied psychology as a way to
        understand human beings and every single career choice beyond
        that point has been molded by my desire to connect with people. This time around it is no different. I believe
        technology can be the link we
        need to unify people and in my particular case, it can be the instrument with which I can make a difference in
        my country. I call technology,
        the great equalizer. In a country where most jobs require a specific journey in which networking can only be
        counted if it's a close friend or
        family member, the tech world demands openness. When looking for qualified people we open ourselves to meet
        people that are not from our
        background. In this way I hope to unify my passions for teaching, learning and people by learning programming
        and finding a way to educate Dominicans
        don't have access to the resources I do. Follow me as I take on this journey of Psycholpogist/Educator to
        Software Engineer. From 0 to Junior </p>
